# [API Tool Calls](https://apitoolcalls.com)

[API Tool Calls](https://apitoolcalls.com): connect once to one small MCP door at https://apitoolcalls.com/mcp. Its 3 meta tools find, describe and call any of our 90 tools, with under 1k tokens of definitions at connection time however many tools ship. Directory scanners and clients that need the full tool listing can read https://apitoolcalls.com/mcp?tools=all.

```

## Connect

- Remote MCP endpoint: `https://apitoolcalls.com/mcp`, Streamable HTTP.
- Command line by [API Tool Calls](https://apitoolcalls.com) (Cowerx), Python 3.8+: install from `https://apitoolcalls.com/apitc`, then `apitc search "qr code"` and `apitc call make_qr --arg text=https://example.com -o qr.json`.
- No key uses the free allowance, or set `APITC_KEY` / `--key` for an existing key.

## Tools

| Tool | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `apa_citation_generator` | Format an APA reference and in-text citations from entered source metadata. |
| `average_calculator` | Compute mean, median, modes, range, sum, count, population and sample standard deviation, plus an optional separately weighted average. |
| `base_convert` | Converts a bounded integer string between bases 2 through 36 using exact BigInt arithmetic. Inputs contain 1–4096 digits and must be valid in the source base. Optional bitWidth (1–4096) validates a bit pattern; signed=true requires a width and reads the source value as two’s complement. Unsigned is the default. |
| `basement_water_cause` | Narrow down why a basement gets wet and who fixes it. Eight observation groups return every rule-matched possible cause, evidence, safe first checks, trade referrals and sources. Hazard stops come first; no probabilities or structural diagnosis. Pure rules, no network or model. |
| `bmi_calculator` | Calculate adult BMI and its band from weight, height and units. |
| `board_feet` | Sum board-foot lumber volumes from entered dimensions and whole piece counts, with per-row optional prices and a priced subtotal. |
| `body_fat_calculator` | Calculate Navy body fat percentage from sex and tape measurements. |
| `calendar_age_difference` | Calculate years, months, days and total days between two birth dates. Use explicit Gregorian dates and a stated month-end convention. |

| `company_facts` | Read a business's own home, about and contact pages and return its name, address, phone, email, founding year and what it does, each with the page it came from. Page text goes to a language model: with no key, a small shared free daily allowance (Google Gemini); with an X-OpenRouter-Key header, the caller's OpenRouter key. |
| `compound_interest_calculator` | Calculate compound or simple interest, balance, total contributed, interest earned, modeled APY and yearly balances from principal, nominal rate, term and deposit timing. |
| `concrete_calculator` | Computes slab, footing, cylindrical-column or solid-step concrete volume, waste allowance and whole 40/60/80 lb bag counts from QUIKRETE No. 1101 yields. |
| `date_calculator` | Count signed calendar days or weekdays between dates, or add and subtract calendar units with month-end clamping. |
| `debt_to_income` | Arithmetic on entered numbers only: sum up to 100 entered monthly debt payments and divide by positive gross monthly income. Shows the sum and ratio percentage, rounded half up to two decimal places, with no comparison bands or classification. |
| `decimal_to_fraction` | Converts a terminating or explicitly repeating decimal to an exact simplified fraction, mixed number and decimal display. |
| `discount_calculator` | Calculate a discounted price, ordered stacked percentage discounts, savings, effective discount and total with an entered sales tax percentage after discounts. |

Base, drainage and permits are not priced; removal is priced only for an existing concrete driveway. Includes unpriced checks, two separate national reference cards and dated sources. Pure arithmetic, no network or model. |
| `epoch_convert` | Convert between Unix timestamps and dates. Converts a Unix timestamp (seconds or milliseconds, detected by size) or an ISO 8601 date string to epoch seconds, epoch milliseconds, an ISO UTC time, the same moment in an optional IANA time zone, and the weekday there. A date string with no offset is read in the given zone, UTC by default. Pure standard-library rules, no network, model or clock. |

Returns safety first, the exact 125% minimum breaker calculation, panel triage, unpriced extras and dated federal 30C rules. Reference cards are utility and DOE program figures, not a price for this home. A licensed electrician and permit are needed; confirm local requirements and inspection. Pure rules and Decimal, no network, model or clock. Web and MCP share the free daily allowance. |
| `fence_cost` | Estimate fence and gate costs from net non-gate length and gate widths. Returns calculated low, median bid and high bounds from exact City of Sunrise FL 2020 municipal bid rows, their scope and sources, and local permit guidance. Historical public bid observations are not current homeowner prices. |

## Limits and errors

Without an [API Tool Calls](https://apitoolcalls.com) key: 20 tool calls per IP per UTC day, shared across tools. Free calls also share a global ceiling of 2,000 per UTC day; recall has no separate tool cap.
Agent calls have no [API Tool Calls](https://apitoolcalls.com) charge; no key is sold. The proofreader and company facts use a small shared free daily allowance, or your OpenRouter key (X-OpenRouter-Key header), which bills the provider request to you. Existing keys still work: 1,000 calls per UTC month, shared across tools.
Validated calls can count even if processing fails.

Proofreader validation and provider errors arrive as MCP `result.isError` with text content, even with HTTP 200. A missing OpenRouter key spends no free call.

Other MCP errors arrive as JSON-RPC `error.code` and `error.message`, even with HTTP 200:

| Code | Meaning / typical message |
| --- | --- |
| `-32602` | Invalid arguments; message names the field or unknown tool. |
| `-32000` | Free daily limit reached; the message says it resets at midnight UTC. |
| `-32001` | Unknown, invalid or inactive [API Tool Calls](https://apitoolcalls.com) key. |
| `-32002` | `Monthly key limit reached (1,000 calls this UTC month).` |
| `-32003` | Captions disabled/missing, unavailable video, résumé input/data error, or unreadable/blocked/oversize HTML page; read the message. |
| `-32004` | `YouTube did not answer; try again later`, `Résumé check is unavailable; try again later`, `Could not read this page; try again later`, `Data Finder is unavailable; try again later`, or `Recall data is updating, try later`. |

For a key the user already has, add the HTTP header
`Authorization: Bearer ot_live_...` in the client's MCP configuration.
Keep the key in client credentials or environment settings, outside tool arguments.
For tools without BYOK, free access omits the Authorization header. Proofreader requests still require X-OpenRouter-Key. Agent tool information is at
`https://apitoolcalls.com/api/`. Client setup is documented in the pack README.
